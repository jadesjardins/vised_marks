The vised_marks extension for EEGLAB is the concatenation of two previously independent plugins for EEGLAB.

VISED
The VisEd extension for EEGLAB adds editing functions to the native eegplot data scrolling figure. Specifically, it allows adding/editing event markers, flagging channels/components, flagging time periods (native toe eegplot) and displaying the properties of the marks structure (see the Marks extension for EEGLAB).

MARKS
EEGLAB file pop_epoch was changed to include the optional input "startpnt"...
EEGLAB file eeg_regepochs was changed to round the latency values of the the events...

The goal of the Marks extension for EEGLAB is to provide an interface and data structure for managing the flagging of channels/components and time periods. The marks data structure is compatible with the Vised EEGLAB extension (version 2.0 or later) for displaying flagged time periods and signals. The Marks extension also provides tools for epoch the data for artifact detection then concatenating the data back into a continuous form while storing the rejection information in the marks structure.
